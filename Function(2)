Input:

fun major(add1:String,add2:String) {
    val m = "Major in $add1 and $add2"
    println(m)
}
fun minor (add3:String,add4:String ) = println("Minor in $add3 or $add4")

fun main(){
    major(add1 = "Electronics Engineering",add2 = "Communication Engineering")
    major(add1 = "Communication Engineering",add2 = "Electronics Engineering")
    minor(add3 = "Computer Science Engineering",add4 = "Information Technology")
    minor(add3 = "Information Technology",add4 = "Computer Science Engineering")
}

Output:
Major in Electronics Engineering and Communication Engineering
Major in Communication Engineering and Electronics Engineering
Minor in Computer Science Engineering or Information Technology
Minor in Information Technology or Computer Science Engineering
